EMPLOYEE WELLNESS PRODUCTIVITY TRACKER 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
Problem Statement

Employee well-being has a direct impact on productivity, retention, and overall organizational success. However, most organizations face challenges in effectively monitoring wellness and productivity due to:
# Disconnected HR systems and data silos.
# Limited visibility into employee stress, engagement, and burnout.
# Reactive wellness programs that lack personalization.
# Difficulty linking wellness insights with performance outcomes.
As a result, companies struggle to take proactive measures that improve employee satisfaction and organizational performance.

This project, Employee Wellness & Productivity Tracker in Salesforce, aims to address these gaps by providing a unified platform that integrates employee wellness data with productivity metrics, enabling data-driven decisions and fostering a healthier, more engaged workforce.
